### Example prompts, which can be tried.
Creative/Storytelling

"Write a short fantasy story about a young princess who must be rescued by a brave knight."

Potential Issues:
Reinforces outdated gender roles, portraying women as helpless and men as saviours.
Excludes non-binary characters and relationships, sticking to a binary understanding of gender.
Lacks diversity or room for creative reinterpretation of traditional roles.



Medical 
 
Un-Checked Prompt ("Before"):
"Write a list of common signs of heart disease in adults."
 
Potential Issues:
This prompt could result in output that is primarily based on male-centric data. Traditionally, medical research has been male-focused, so this may lead to an incomplete or inaccurate list for women, who might present heart disease symptoms differently.
Gender bias in research may underreport or overlook how certain signs of heart disease manifest in women, potentially leading to under-diagnosis or misdiagnosis.
 
Marketing
 
Un-Checked Prompt ("Before"):
"Create an advertising campaign for a luxury car emphasising power, control, and the thrill of the open road."
 
Potential Issues:
The focus on “power” and “control” may lean into traditional, gendered ideas of strength and assertiveness.
Assumes that all luxury car buyers are looking for the same features and qualities, potentially missing diverse consumer needs like safety, comfort, or technological innovation.
Customer Service
 
Un-Checked Prompt ("Before"):
"Write a list of chatbot recommendations for exercise wear for women, focusing on clothes that are stylish and figure-flattering, ideal for light yoga or pilates."
 
Potential Issues:
Limits the range of activities for women to "light yoga or pilates," excluding those who may participate in high-intensity or heavy lifting workouts.
Assumes that women prioritise style and figure-flattery over comfort, durability, or performance.
Reinforces the stereotype that women’s exercise wear should emphasise appearance rather than function or performance.


#### Longer Examples
Biased Text:
Write a job description for a Business Analyst. The ideal candidate should be a high performer who shows everyone how great they are,  with a killer instinct, willing to work around the clock to ship user stories fast. They should be ready to ‘own’ projects and make tough calls under pressure. This is a demanding role for someone who thrives on competition and isn’t afraid to step on toes to get the job done.
Analysis of Bias:
"Shows everyone how great they are": This phrase can be interpreted as self-promotion, which may be perceived as more acceptable for men than women in some workplaces.
"Killer instinct": This aggressive and competitive term can create an exclusionary environment, particularly for women who may be socialized to prioritize collaboration and teamwork.
"Work around the clock": This implies a need for excessive work hours, which can disproportionately impact women who often shoulder a greater share of domestic responsibilities.
"Own' projects and make tough calls under pressure": While these qualities are valuable, the emphasis on individual ownership and decisiveness can inadvertently discourage collaborative approaches and create a more competitive and potentially hostile work environment.
"Thrives on competition and isn’t afraid to step on toes": This language promotes a competitive and individualistic approach that may not align with the values of all potential candidates and can create a culture of conflict.
Corrected Not Biased Text:
Write a job description for a Business Analyst. The ideal candidate is a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. They should possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills, enabling effective collaboration with cross-functional teams. The candidate should be a proactive and independent thinker, capable of identifying and addressing business needs, while also demonstrating a strong work ethic and commitment to delivering high-quality results within deadlines. They should be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, adapting to changing priorities, and effectively managing competing demands.
Key Changes:
Focus on skills and abilities: The revised version emphasizes essential skills like analytical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork, rather than personality traits that may have gendered connotations.
Emphasis on collaboration: The revised version highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration, creating a more inclusive and supportive work environment.
Focus on work ethic and results: The revised version emphasizes work ethic, commitment to results, and the ability to adapt to a fast-paced environment, while avoiding language that promotes excessive work hours or aggressive competition.
Removed gendered terms: Terms like "killer instinct," "shows everyone how great they are," and "step on toes" have been removed to create a more inclusive and respectful environment.
This revised version aims to be more objective, inclusive, and free from gender bias while still effectively communicating the essential requirements for the Business Analyst role.
